capture_relighting.py -- MECH5720 Lab 2

Capture a scene under multiplexed illumination.

A monitor acts as the illumination source: it is divided into a grid of
patches ("illumination sites") that are switched on and off in a known
sequence, while the camera records the scene's appearance under each
pattern. The resulting image stacks are what relighting.py consumes.

Five stacks are produced:

    Multiplexed*.dng    the multiplexing patterns from H  (needed)
    Ambient*.dng        all sites off                     (needed)
    Impulse*.dng        one site on at a time             (comparison)
    AllOn*.dng          all sites on                      (comparison)
    FirstOn*.dng        only site 1 on                    (comparison)

Frames are written as DNG (untouched sensor raw, plus the metadata --
black level, colour gains, Bayer pattern -- needed to interpret it),
not PNG: no bit-shifting or scaling happens on the way to disk.

Run this on the Raspberry Pi, with the illumination monitor connected.
The illumination window goes fullscreen. To start the run, press ENTER
either on the illumination screen itself (if a keyboard is plugged into
the Pi) or in the SSH terminal you launched the script from -- type
'q' + ENTER in the terminal to abort instead. You never need physical
access to the Pi once the run starts.

Over SSH you must also tell it which display to draw on:

    DISPLAY=:0 python3 capture_relighting.py

Run with --preflight first. It checks that your exposure, gain and
ambient stability are good enough to be worth capturing 78 frames.
