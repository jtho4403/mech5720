"""
MECH5720 Lab 2 -- Multiplexing for Relighting.

Relight a scene from a stack of images captured under multiplexed
illumination, and measure the signal-to-noise advantage that
multiplexing buys you over illuminating one site at a time.

Run this by stepping through it in your debugger rather than executing
it end to end. Set a breakpoint at the first section and step forward,
watching each figure as it appears. Every step you complete should
produce a visible change in the figures.

# An "S-matrix" built from a Hadamard matrix, following Schechner et al.
# 2007, "Multiplexing for Optimal Lighting", Appendix A. Row i gives the
# illumination pattern used for multiplexed frame i: a 1 means that site
# was on. Dropping the first row and column of the Hadamard matrix
# removes the all-on pattern, which carries no differential information.
# H must match the matrix used at capture time.

# ======================================================================

# ======================================================================
# 4. Remove the ambient contribution
# ======================================================================
# The multiplexing model describes only the light you control. Ambient
# light is a constant offset present in every frame, so subtract it.
#
# Note what we do NOT do here. It is tempting to clamp the result at
# zero, on the grounds that there is no such thing as negative light.
# Do not. Where the controlled illumination is weaker than the noise,
# roughly half the pixels legitimately read below ambient, and clamping
# them discards the negative half of a symmetric noise distribution.
# That leaves a positive bias in every frame, which propagates into
# every measurement you make later. Negative values here are noise, not
# an error, and they must be allowed to cancel. Clamping is for display
# only, and imaging.show() already handles it.

# TODO 2: subtract the ambient estimate from the multiplexed stack.

# 5. Demultiplex
# ======================================================================
# Each multiplexed frame is a sum of the single-site images selected by
# one row of H:   mux = H @ single_site.  Recovering the single-site
# images is therefore a linear solve, applied identically to every pixel
# and every colour channel. Flatten so that each row is one frame.
